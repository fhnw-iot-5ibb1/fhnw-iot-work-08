### a) Arduino LoRaWAN, 15'
* Get an account at https://thethingsnetwork.org/
* Register an application with two (Arduino) devices.
* Get ABP keys for one device, OTAA keys for another.
* Run the previous Arduino LoRaWAN .ino examples.
* Make sure to set the pin map, keys in the source

### b) TTN integrations, 15'
* Read the TTN [HTTP](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/applications/http/) and [MQTT](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/applications/mqtt/api.html) data API docs.
* Use the Raspberry Pi as an application backend.
* Set up an HTTP Service to log TTN Webhook calls.
* Run a MQTT (sub) client to log incoming messages.

### c) LoRaWAN use cases, 15'
* Which applications become possible with LoRaWAN?
* Does free wide area connectivity change anything?
* Sketch the reference model for an application.
* Find a case that clearly beats Wi-Fi, 3/4G.
